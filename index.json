The \u0026lsquo;Charging LED\u0026rsquo; indicator will light red, while the \u0026lsquo;Fully Charged LED\u0026rsquo; will remain off. Once fully charged, the \u0026lsquo;Fully Charged LED\u0026rsquo; indicator will light green, and the \u0026lsquo;Charging LED\u0026rsquo; will turn off. Set the \u0026lsquo;Charge Switch\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;OFF\u0026rsquo; to power the microcontroller with its onboard battery. The microcontroller may be used during charging.\n"

Using a smartphone, computer, or tablet, locate and connect to the Stingray access point with the same IP address as your device. After successfully connecting to the Stingray access point, open your web browser and enter your device\u0026rsquo;s IP address into the address bar. Provide the SSID and password for a Wi-Fi network to establish internet connectivity. For optimal performance, connect your Stingray to a Wi-Fi network with fewer connected devices, such as a smartphone\u0026rsquo;s hotspot. This can help avoid potential network issues.\n"

	"content": "Uploading the OTA program to a new Stingray WF1.0 with an Arduino UNO Connect an Arduino UNO to a computer and upload a sketch with an empty setup and loop method. Connect the GND of the Arduino to the GND of the Stingray. Connect Tx of the Arduino to Tx of the Stingray and connect Rx of the Arduino to the Rx of the Stingray. Connect a 330-ohm resistor to GND and connect the other terminal to a free wire. Connect another free wire to GND. Set the board of Arduino Sketch to NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module). Put the microcontroller into programming mode by holding the free GND wire on the pin of the WiFi module, that is closest to the pin that says Rx on the Stingray. Insert the free wire coming from the 330-ohm resistor into D4. Wait 2 seconds. Remove the free GND wire from the WiFi module followed by removing the wire from D4. Set the ipAd1 to ipAd4 int variables in the [[Default Stingray WF1.0 OTA File|Default-Stingray-WF1.0-OTA-File]] to serve as the \u0026lsquo;Device ID\u0026rsquo; and the homepage of the Stingray WF1.0 microcontroller. E.g., The code: int ipAd1=192; int ipAd2=168; int ipAd3=4; int ipAd4=12; will configure the \u0026lsquo;Device ID\u0026rsquo; as 192.168.4.12 and set the homepage of the Stingray WF1.0 microcontroller to http://192.168.4.12/.\nCompile and upload the Default Stingray WF1.0 OTA File to the Stingray WF1.0 microcontroller.

Doing so may cause the firmware to crash, which would require uploading the firmware again.\nA rapidly flashing blue light on the Stingray indicates that the Stingray will attempt to begin requesting this compiled file. Note: once a file is found, the blue light will stop flashing, and it will take about 20 seconds for the new program to be burnt onto the microcontroller.
